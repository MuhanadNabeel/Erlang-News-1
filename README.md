Erlang-News
===========
With Erlang gaining popularity amongst developers around the world with communities and
forums, we have decided to select Erlang news as our information domain. There are few
centralised hubs of hot news - ranging in variety - and we believe we can penetrate the market with
a more centralised solution. We have chosen the following sources that already aggregate news
from their own independent sources, however they range in variety. By combining the following we
believe we can achieve a unique product, displaying various topics associated with Erlang, such as
software updates, jobs, events, tutorials, projects and more.


The purpose of the project is to develop a business intelligence (BI) system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the Erlang-News server follow these steps:

* Open a terminal
* Navigate to the back-end folder
* Execute the command "erl -make"
* Execute the command "erl -pa ebin"
* After the Erlang shell has started execute the command "application:start(ernews_app)."
* Sit back and enjoy

P.S.
you can find the log_report afterward in the same folder in the file log_report
